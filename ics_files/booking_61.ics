DESCRIPTION:The SBR and JCR are super excited to announce the 

GREAT JOHNIAN (NO) BAKE OFF! 

In honour of HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, the theme will be the Royal Family - so get creative!! References to Meghan and Harryâ€™s Oprah interview are strongly encouraged. Please note that lack of oven is no problem, and repurposing of shop-bought goodies is 100% allowed.

Judgement will take place via Instagram, in person and by the Great Bill Brogan himself. 

To attend this event, you must be actively participating in the Asymptomatic Testing Program. This is super important for us to continue to plan in-person events this term. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
