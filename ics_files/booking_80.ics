DESCRIPTION:Need an escape from the real world? Be transported with a good book - the perfect lockdown activity. Meet for weekly discussions and get a free book too. We will vote on a book once we have an idea of numbers.

And please suggest any books you think would be good: classics you\'ve always wanted some added incentive to read, an amazing book you want to share, or one that\'s come highly recommended to you.

If there\'s enough interest we may have more than one group, with the option to have different books read in each group.

I\'ll also be posting a list of book recommendations and will include suggestions. So keep an eye out if you\'re interested.

(Tom will drop the books into your pigeon hole as soon as they arrive)
