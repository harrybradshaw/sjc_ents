DESCRIPTION:Join us for a fab evening with your fellow postgrads and a Pimm\'s or four (please drink responsibly, we will cut you off otherwise)! A few details to be aware of before arriving:

1. Restroom access is available but limited, so use the loo before if possible!
2. Registering for the event serves as a declaration that, to the best of your knowledge, you have not been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID or displayed COVID-like symptoms.
3. Be prepared to have your asymptomatic test results (or NHS lateral flow if you aren\'t eligible for the asymptomatic testing scheme) when checking in with a committee member. You\'ll also be provided with a lovely squirt of isopropanol-scented hand sani!
4. You\'ll be placed in a group of six with the folks you arrive with; no mixing of groups is allowed throughout the event because we\'re operating above the 30-person limit set out in government guidelines, so coordinate with your mates or make some new friends!
5. Non-alcoholic refreshments available to those who would like!
6. Have fun and be yourself xoxo
